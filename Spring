Q: When do we go with Setter and Constructor Injection, pros and cons
A: Difference 
# constructor based injection: 
1) It can be used when object's dependencies are not optional and they must be initialized with their dependencies
2) It can be used if the order of initialization or dependency matters
# Property based injection:
1) when dependencies are optional
2) if the order of initialization or dependency doesn't matters

Q: Spring Security Example: Limit Number of User Session
XML Configuration:
<session-management invalid-session-url="/logout.html">
    <concurrency-control max-sessions="1" error-if-maximum-exceeded="true" />
</session-management>
Java configuration

Q: Spring security Example: Session timeout
XML Configuration:
<session-config>
    <session-timeout>15</session-timeout>
    <tracking-mode>COOKIE</tracking-mode>
</session-config>

Q: Role of DispatcherServlet and ContextLoaderListener
DispatcherServlet is basically the front controller in the Spring MVC application as it loads the spring bean configuration file 
and initializes all the beans that have been configured. If annotations are enabled, it also scans the packages to configure any bean 
annotated with @Component, @Controller, @Repository or @Service annotations.

ContextLoaderListener, on the other hand, is the listener to start up and shut down the WebApplicationContext in Spring root. 
Some of its important functions includes tying up the lifecycle of ApplicationContext to the lifecycle of the ServletContext and 
automating the creation of ApplicationContext.

Q: uses of the JDBC template in Spring
The Spring JDBC template automatically cleans up the resources; like releasing database connections.
The Spring JDBC template converts the standard JDBC SQLExceptions into RuntimeExceptions. 
This ensures faster response time to identify and eliminate errors.
