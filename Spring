Q: When do we go with Setter and Constructor Injection, pros and cons
A: Difference 
# constructor based injection: 
1) It can be used when object's dependencies are not optional and they must be initialized with their dependencies
2) It can be used if the order of initialization or dependency matters
# Property based injection:
1) when dependencies are optional
2) if the order of initialization or dependency doesn't matters
